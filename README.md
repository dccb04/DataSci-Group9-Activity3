## 📖 Project Overview

Our Streamlit web project is designed to showcase what we learned during the past weeks with the use of a csv retrieved from Kaggle [Phishing URL Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergioagudelo/phishing-url-detection). The app will comprise of multiple bar charts and pie charts.<br>


Additionally, the application includes an analysis on the Phishing URL Detection dataset from Kaggle. This section covers:

- Displaying Dataframe for each graph with Analyzation
- Visualization with the use of Graphs
- Analyzation and Obeservation of the relevant datatypes and graphs
